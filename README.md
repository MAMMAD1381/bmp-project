# bmp-project
>**simple c project that process based on the given database to figure out the given numbers**

on this project i used a c library named **bmpio**
this library can process the images with bmp format ([more about bmp images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format))

the program is designed that as it would be given some images as data
then the program should process the images of single numbers
then you can pass the program image of a time (simple time format -> hour:minute:seconds) so that the program can specify the given time
